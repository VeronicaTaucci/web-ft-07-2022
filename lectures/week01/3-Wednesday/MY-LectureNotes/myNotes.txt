#! variables - like a label for something. Reserved words: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords
    variable = value
    identifier = expression

#! String Formatting : By argument, By index, By keyword
    f-strings: string literals that have an f at the beginning and curly braces containing expressions that will be replaced with their values.
        f'some string {variable}'

#! Built in functions

    input() - function waits for the user to type some input and press return. It then gets whatever was typed.
    int() - Converts a string to a number
    type() - method returns class type of the argument(object) passed as parameter.
    isinstance() - function returns True if the specified object is of the specified type, otherwise False.
