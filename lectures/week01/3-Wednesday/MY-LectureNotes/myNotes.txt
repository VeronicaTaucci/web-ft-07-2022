Memory heap -(address,value,label, datatype) The heap is a memory used by programming languages to store global variables.
Execution context - is an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed.

#! Basic Data Types:
String - string is text created by putting quotes around text.
Integer - 5
Float - 5.6
Boolean - False and True


# Concatenating Strings - merging two strings into a single object which is done by using the “+” operator.
# Escaping Characters
        \b	backspace
        \t	horizontal tab
        \v	vertical tab
        \n	newline

#Python Operators
        +	Addition
        -	Subtraction
        *	Multiplication
        /	Division
        //  division w/o decimal    
        %   modulus/remainder    
        **  exponentiation

#! variables - like a label for something. Reserved words: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords
    variable = value
    identifier = expression

#! String Formatting : By argument, By index, By keyword
    f-strings: string literals that have an f at the beginning and curly braces containing expressions that will be replaced with their values.
        f'some string {variable}'

#! Built in functions
    print() - The print command causes output to appear on your terminal screen. 
    input() - function waits for the user to type some input and press return. It then gets whatever was typed.
    int() - Converts a string to a number
    type() - method returns class type of the argument(object) passed as parameter.
    isinstance() - function returns True if the specified object is of the specified type, otherwise False.

#! Comparison Operators:
        Equal to: ==
        Not equal to: !=
        Less than: <
        Greater than: >
        Less than or equal to: <=
        Greater than or equal to: >=
    not will negate the operator!
#! Logical Operators:
        and operator – returns True if both the operands (right side and left side) are True
        or operator - returns True if either of the operand (right side or left side) is True
        not operator - returns True if operand is False
